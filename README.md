# uFail - Legacy

Started as my first dive into programming in 2010 when I was 14. uFail was updated for 10 years until I finally set sail on it in late 2020. 

uFail started in objective-c with XIB files and later made the migration to Swift and Storyboards.

uFail is now legacy meaning I will not be updating it anymore unless there is something required to make it run, feel free to browse the code that makes it run even though it might be a little messy.
